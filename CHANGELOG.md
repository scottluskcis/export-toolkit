## ðŸš€ Migration Note

**The package has been renamed from `@scottluskcis/outport` to `@scottluskcis/export-toolkit`.**

To migrate:

```bash
# Uninstall the old package
npm uninstall @scottluskcis/outport

# Install the new package
npm install @scottluskcis/export-toolkit
```

Update your imports:

```typescript
// Before
import { outport } from '@scottluskcis/outport';

// After
import { outport } from '@scottluskcis/export-toolkit';
```

The API remains unchanged - only the package name has changed.
